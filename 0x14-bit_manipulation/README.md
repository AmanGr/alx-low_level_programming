0x14-bit_manipulation
Overview
This project involves creation of various C-functions and C-programs that make use of bit manipulation concepts in the C-programming language.

Files
main.h
Project header file that contains all function prototypes for functions described below.

0-binary_to_uint.c
This is a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

b points to a string of 0 and 1 chars
The function returns:
The converted number or 0 if
there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
b is NULL
1-print_binary.c
This function prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

The following were were not allowed to be used in the function:

arrays
malloc function
% and / operators
2-get_bit.c
This function returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

index is the index, starting from 0, of the bit to obtain
Returns the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occurs
3-set_bit.c
This function sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

index is the index, starting from 0, of the bit to be set.
Returns: 1 if the function is successful -1 if an error occurs
4-clear_bit.c
This function sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

index is the index, starting from 0, of the bit to be set.
Returns: 1 if the function is successful -1 if an error occured
5-flip_bits.c
This function returns the number of bits that will need to be flipped to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsiged long int n, unsigned long int m);

The % and / operators were forbidden for use
100-get_endianness.c
This function checks the endianness

Prototype: int get_endianness(void);

Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian
101-password
This file contains the password for the crackme3 program.
