clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
oclean: deletes the object files
fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
re: forces recompilation of all source files
variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM, CFLAGS
CC: the compiler to be used
SRC: the .c files
OBJ: the .o files
NAME: the name of the executable
RM: the program to delete files
CFLAGS: your favorite compiler flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail

You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files
CC= gcc
SRC= main.c school.c
OBJ= $(SRC:.c=.o)
NAME= school

CFLAGS= -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic

all: $(OBJ)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

.PHONY: clean oclean fclean re

oclean: 
    $(RM) -rf $(OBJ)
